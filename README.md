# OCP-Notes

# Chapter-5: 
1. OpenShift implements a software-defined network (SDN) to manage the "network infrastructure of the cluster & user applications"
   
2. In OpenShift Container Platform, the SDN satisfies the following five requirements:
    • Managing the network traffic and network resources programmatically, so that the organization teams can decide how to expose their applications.
    • Managing communication between containers that run in the same project.
    • Managing communication between pods, whether they belong to a same project or run in separate projects.
    • Managing network communication from a pod to a service.
    • Managing network communication from an external network to a service, or from containers to external networks.
